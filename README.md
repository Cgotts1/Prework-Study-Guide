# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation for this project was to create a study guide that is easily accessible and easy to read for new students who we'll be participatng in the bootcamp. I built this project to help me with the basics of CSS, Git, HTML, and JavaScript as those well be used extensively throughout the bootcamp. It solves the problem of not having access to a studyguide when refreshing on material taught throughout the prework-study-guide project. Doing this first project taught me the very basics of how to implement HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript when creating an application or website. I also learned how to keep the local repository and git repository in sync with one another, so that when working on future group assignments, there will be a consistent work flow between peers.

## Usage

This prework-study-guide can be used to help with revision of basic information regarding HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. HTML works in the same way as the structure for a house in that it makes up the frame of the website. So in the HTML section, there are notes describing some basic componenets of what the head, body, etc. contribute to the webpage. CSS is used for styling, so in it's respective section, there are some commands listed with an explanation as to what they do when called upon. This can be seen in the Git section as well where there are a few essential commands listed in respect to keeping the local and git repositories in sync with one another. Lastly, there's the JavaScript section that icludes some terms and definitions associated with the language that will be used frequently thoughout the bootcamp in order to bring functionality our websites.
